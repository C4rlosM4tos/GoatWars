# GoatWars
Goat Wars decentralized blockchain game


GoatWars is going to be a decentralized blockchain game when its finished.

It will use NFT (erc721) like goats to battle. 

The Art will be hosted on ipfs and linked to a certain coin number. (each non-fungible coin is a digital goat).

the hash of the link will be stored inside the token.

The game will be created on FTM fantom chain, because the fees are low. this is good for players and dev's.

The game will use GC goatCoin as its game currency. however, the game is build on ftm so each transaction will cost some FTM tokens. (0.000...1)

Game map:       the world map will be a 2 dimensional grid ( X ; Y ) filled with plots of land. As more land is sold, new plots should be created.
                (2 new auctions start after 1 plot is sold)

ownable Game_Objects: 



  Plot of land:  piece of land on the map, starting from X to X and ending at Y to Y.
               land can be used to build a farm on, or as field for the goats (shed)
               
               
  Farm:          required to interact with the game and goats. must be build on a plot of land. 
                 a player can have multiple farms. a farm can have limited fields and goats.
                 a farm can have a cheese makery extension and or milking machines.
               

  Goats:        erc721-like token but on FTM instead of ETH. a goat can fight, breed, produce meat/fibre/milk
                Only male goats will be auctioned, female goats must be won or bred.
                how to do the genetics and fitting image is still unclear...
              

Cheese makery: erc721 object to make cheese. (different machines might have different stats)
